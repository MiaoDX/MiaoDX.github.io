# Why and what

There are lots of nice or great tools on the internet, sometimes I will just forget a possible `Silver bullet` for a particular situation. So this blog is just an entrance to a nice or clean or amzing world just by small tools.

# Windows

## Package manager

Once tried command line, it makes you think `agree the agreements -> choose where to install -> next -> next` unbearable.

Thanks give to [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/#windows)

[chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/)

`choco install WHAT_YOU_WANT`

Or

[scoop](http://scoop.sh/)

`scoop install WHAT_YOU_WANT`

I find scoop latter, but I think it maybe better.

### A small `shell`

[Gow](https://github.com/bmatzelle/gow)

Can be installed via `choco` or `scoop`.

### Dependence Walker

[Dependence Walker](http://www.dependencywalker.com/):

Dependency Walker is also very useful for troubleshooting system errors related to loading and executing modules. Dependency Walker detects many common application problems such as missing modules, invalid modules, import/export mismatches, circular dependency errors, mismatched machine types of modules, and module initialization failures.
